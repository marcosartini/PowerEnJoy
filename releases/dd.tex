\section{Overview}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./dd/layer.pdf}
		\caption{Overview of the system architecture: layer division and tier identification.}
		\label{layerTier}
\end{figure}
The system is multi-tier, in fact it is composed by:
\begin{itemize}
\item the main logic element as the \emph{Application server};
\item a restricted logic element placed on the cars as \emph{On-board system};
\item data are managed and stored in a dedicated server as \emph{Database server} (this component is in charge of the data layer);
\item a web-server is in charge to interact with the users who adopt the website solution and to interface with the application server;
\item presentation layer is assigned to the mobile app, which interfaces directly with the application server, to the \emph{on-board application} which interfaces directly with the \emph{on-board system} and to the web browser which interfaces directly with the web server.
\end{itemize}
The \emph{external systems} icon symbolizes and reminds that the system relies on also other systems to carry out its tasks, such as the interaction with the Payment Handler system and the third party maps service.

\section{Component view}
In this section the components will be presented individually to show up their behavior, their sub-components, how they interface each other.

\subsection{Database}
The database component will include a DBMS to properly manage the data and their handling. It will interact only with the Application Sever, using a secure interface which guarantees the security requirements. Data in this component are stored with particular care on encryption.
The logical data representation is shown in the E-R schema below.
As evident from the schema, a relational database broadly meets the needs of the system.

\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=1.45\textwidth, angle=90]{./dd/er.pdf}
\end{center}

\subsection{Application server}
The application server contains the main logic aspects of the system, except the ones performed by the \emph{on-board system}; the features are implemented by the modules described below.
The application server interfaces with the data layer using a dedicated connector responsible for the communication between the two components. 

The application server is composed by:
\begin{description}
\item[UserManager] this module will take care to handle login requests, registration requests and what concern with this operations such as adding users to the database, generating passwords, checking data consistency and so forth;
\item[CarsManager] this module will take care of car management regarding the status of the car with the respect to the possibility of usage, it will also handle the requests of check availability of a car and modify its status following a reservation or a rental and it will maintain updated the general state of the fleet;
\item[ReservationManager] this module will take care of the reservations, included setting them up, avoiding multiple reservation per same car and/or per same user simultaneously, implementing services to comply with timeout constraints. This module interacts with CarsManager module and PaymentManager module;
\item[RentalManager] this module will take care of the rental aspects, managing rental requests, generating proximity codes, timing the rental, interact with CarsManager, ReservationManager KeepAside Manager and PaymentManager;
\item[KeepAsideManager] this module will take care of the \emph{keep aside} services, timing the keep aside requests, interacting with the RentalManager;
\item[PaymentManager] this module will take care of stating the amount of cash to debit to users based on the duration of benefited services, and will also interact with the payment handler (external system) to have the bills paid;
\item[MapsManager] this module will take care of composing the map view of the available cars and interact with the chosen maps API. This module interacts with the CarsManager;
\item[IssueManager] this module will take care of handling issue and their status;
\item[SettingManager] this module will take care of handling the possibility of edit the rental and keep aside cost per minute.
\end{description}

A graphical description of the modules is showed below: 
\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./dd/componentInterfaces.pdf}
\end{center}

\subsection{On-board car system}
This component is placed on the car, connected to the car control unit with a dedicated interface able to interpret signals provided by the control unit and also able to interact with it sending proper signals to actuate actuators.
It act as a branch of the application server over each car, devoted to the physical control (that is more significant to be confined to the car than to be in charge of the main application server).

CarSystemManager: this module will be a bridge between the electronics of the car and the central system: it will manage actuation requests (such as lock/unlock doors) to interface with the car control unit and it will handle notifications from the car control unit to the central system, in addition to autonomously notify particular events to the central system.

Notice that this component only shows information to the user, but does not take inputs or request except the \emph{unlock code}. This component is not designed to be an interaction component between the user and the application server, like the mobile app does instead.

\subsection{Mobile App client}
The mobile app is probably the primary way the users adopt to interface with the \emph{Power EnJoy} services.
This component interact directly with the Application server due to a dedicated communication protocol.
This component must provide a module to properly handle the geolocalization feature, which is able to get data from the smartphone GPS sensor.

\subsection{Web server}
Since it must be available a web version of the application, it is essential to have a dedicated web server to handle the related requests and responses. The presentation layer of the website is entrusted to the user's web browser.
The web server interfaces with the application server to proper get the information to include in the processing pages. It will also feed the application server with the data received from the user.

\section{Component interfaces}
This section lists the interfaces between components.

\subsection{Application and Database}
The application server interact with the database server supported by the Java Persistence API.

\subsection{Application and Web server}
Direct communications with the web server are based over RESTful APIs served by the Application server. These APIs are implemented in JAX-RS.

\subsection{Application and Clients}
Direct communications with clients, as is the mobile application, are based over RESTful APIs served by the Application server. These APIs are implemented in JAX-RS.

\subsection{Web browser and Web server}
The browsers appointed to deal with the application will communicate with the web server using the HTTPS protocol. The server will reply with the same protocol.

\subsection{Application server and external systems}
The Application server (in particular the PaymentManager module) interfaces with the Payment Handler system using the APIs provided by the Payment Handler system.

\section{Selected architectural styles and pattern}
\subsection{Client/server}
This model is widely used in the system, in fact:
\begin{itemize}
\item the Application Server is the main brain of the system, and the users interact with it using a sort of silly client service as is the mobile application or the website;
\item the Application Server act as a client with the respect to the Database Server;
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Publisher/Subscriber}
The Application Server and the on-board system act each other as a publisher/subscriber model, in fact the application server communicates data to the cars, and also the cars communicates data to the Application server but neither the on-board system nor the Application Server ask for that data.


\subsection{Multi-tier architecture}
The architecture is not centralized in a single component, but is composed by a number of different elements each one with a specific task. This improve efficiency and reliability of the system. This allows the physical delocalization of the elements, the possibility of component replication and so forth to ensure a high quality of service.

\subsection{Thick client}
We think that is better to delegate some of the Application Server logic to the single on-board systems, with the aim of reduce the number of request to the server which are basically related to the physical car and in a smaller part to the general system.
The on-board system needs however to interact with the Application Server on questions in the context of the entire system.

\subsection{Thin client}
The mobile app and the website do not contain any kind of the system logic, and they need to forward all the request to the Application Server to have the job done.

\subsection{Model-View-Control}
This pattern is adopted to achieve a separation among the logic of the system, the presentation layer and the system model. This choice should favor the initial implementation and also future upgrades of the system.

\section{Other design decision}
\subsection{Maps}
To quickly and faithfully dispose of a complete map service, is noticeable the ranking of \emph{Google Maps} as maps maker, addresses translator, maps updater and APIs provider to interface and take advantage of its functionalities. We think that now it is the best choice to adopt in this scope.


\chapter{Algorithm design}
This chapter includes some algorithms we want to describe. The code is described in the sections of the chapter.
\lstinputlisting[breaklines, language=Java]{./dd/codeSource.java}

\section{Compute Discount and overcharges}
For first and second discount, on board system is able to detect if discount conditions are satisfied thanks to cars sensor and notify it to the application.
For third discount, application waits five minutes after user exits the car: if at the end of 5 minutes car results in charging, therefore system applies discount, otherwise no discount is applied.
For overcharges : car battery Level is notified by on-board system to application, so application can evaluate to apply overcharge or not. If no station is found near the car (noPowerGridStationNear returns \emph{false}), overcharges will be applied.
Discount is saved as negative float between 0 and -1; overcharge is saved as positive float between 0 and 1.
Application must hold only the minimum value (corresponding to the maximum discount obtained) and the maximum value (corresponding to the overcharge).
At the end, application multiplies each element of this list for the total price computed before and sum them with total price.

\section{Compute rental charge and total price}
System computes rental charge and total price only after 5 minutes after user exits the car (system waits to understand if apply or not the third discount).
After that application can compute total price as showed in the algorithm above.

\chapter{User interface design}

\section{UX diagram}
In this section we include a UX diagram which allows to clearly identify the screens and their interaction. Screens related to \emph{employees} are available only in the website version.
